Turning User Needs into a Program
The best way to build a program that people actually want to use is to:

Talk to Them: Ask users or stakeholders what they want, what problems they’re facing, and what they hope the program will do.
Break It Down: Turn their needs into small, clear tasks or features that can be added to the program.
Focus on What Matters: Figure out what’s most important to them and start there.
Why Use User Stories?
User stories are simple, one-sentence descriptions of what the user wants. For example:

"As a teacher, I want to easily create quizzes so my students can practice at home."
Why They’re Helpful:
They keep you focused on what the user actually needs.
Everyone on the team can understand them—no tech jargon required.
They’re flexible and easy to adjust if things change.
How to Start Building a Program
Plan the Basics: Understand the problem, think about what the program needs to do, and make a simple plan.
Take Small Steps: Build one feature at a time, test it, and make sure it works before moving on.
Test Early and Often: Check constantly to see if the program is doing what the users need.
Agile Methods I Want to Use
Scrum: Work in short bursts (called sprints), have quick daily check-ins, and learn from each sprint to improve.
Kanban: Use a simple board to track what needs to be done, what’s in progress, and what’s finished.
Get Feedback Fast: Show users the work often so you can fix things early and keep them happy.
Keep Improving: Always test, tweak, and add to the program as you go.
Being a Good Team Member
Talk and Listen: Share your ideas, listen to others, and make sure everyone’s on the same page.
Help Each Other: Jump in when someone on the team needs help, and don’t be afraid to ask for help yourself.
Own Your Work: Be responsible for your tasks and get them done on time.
Go With the Flow: Be ready to adapt when plans change (because they always do).
Be Nice: Respect others, appreciate their ideas, and work together without drama.
Keep Learning: Stay curious and keep picking up new skills or tools to do your best work.
In short, focus on the people you’re building for, work well with your team, and keep improving as you go!
